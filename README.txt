To run the demos, download a Factor binary from http://factorcode.org.
Make sure to get the development release, not the stable release.

Run Factor, and type

"/Users/slava/emerginglangs/" add-vocab-root
"emerging-langs-talk" run

Of course replacing the path with the path to the directory containing
README.txt.
