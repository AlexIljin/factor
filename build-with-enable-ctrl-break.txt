1. check out the latest master;
2. build with VS2015:
  - start env-32.bat;
  - run build-1.cmd;
3. the new factor.exe should appear, but it will fail to bootstrap because enable-ctrl-break functions will be missing in the bootstrap image;
4. run factor.exe and execute USE: bootstrap.image "windows-x86.32" make-image to produce a new bootstrap image;
5. run build-2.cmd to create the full factor.image.
