Hello!

I want to describe how to run Factors unit testing suite. Perhaps not
everyone on the mailing list knows about it? Anyways, running the test
suites and reporting any failures is a great way to improve
Factor. Unexpected test failures can reveal bugs that are otherwise
very hard to find.

Here is how you do it on Windows:

1. First you download a release of Factor and get it running.
2. Go either to http://downloads.factorcode.org/dlls/64/ or
   http://downloads.factorcode.org/dlls/ for 64 and 32bit builds of
   Factor respectively.
3. Download all the dlls and put them in the same directory as the
   factor.exe file.
4. Run factor.com -run=listener in a cmd.exe window.
5. Then type "load-all test-all"
6. Then go for a walk or something :) It takes up to two hours
   for all the test suites to finish.
7. If there are test failures you can inspect them by running the
   :test-failures word.
8. If there are so many test failures that they fill up the scrollback
   buffer, you can save them to a file using: [ :test-failures ]
   with-string-writer "test.log" utf8 set-file-contents

If you don't have time for all the test suites, you can run the most
important ones using only "test-all" without "load-all".
